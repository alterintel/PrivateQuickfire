# Quickfire
Quickfire is a Player Organized Initiative to test new StarMade settings in an attempt to find balance for better game play.
The goal is to make the process of changing and testing config settings as open and as quick as possible.  This means rapid server updates and resets, Hence: QuickFire.  The config files are presented here openly so that other players or Server owners can use them to improve their own Starmade game play experience.
